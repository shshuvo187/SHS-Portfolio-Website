# SHS-Portfolio-Website

This project is a **reimplementation and customization** of a portfolio website tutorial from the YouTube channel [Coding Snow](https://youtu.be/0p-Rye_f0EA?si=VEFqWU2l2AucqsAX).

The base structure and idea were inspired by the tutorial, but I rewrote the code from scratch and added my own design choices, features, and layout improvements.  
The goal was to practice front-end development, learn responsive design techniques, and personalize the portfolio for my own use.
